# L2/L3 Shared Cache Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the enhanced L2/L3 shared cache architecture for the RISC-V AI accelerator chip. The implementation includes multi-core shared architecture, advanced arbitration logic, enhanced ECC error detection and correction, and comprehensive integration testing.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Multi-Core Shared L2 Cache Architecture

The L2 cache has been enhanced with the following features:

#### Enhanced Arbitration System
- **QoS-aware arbitration**: Each port has configurable priority levels (3-bit priority)
- **Age-based fairness**: Prevents starvation by tracking request age (8-bit age counter)
- **Round-robin with priority**: Combines round-robin fairness with priority-based scheduling
- **Bandwidth allocation**: Tracks and controls bandwidth usage per port
- **Conflict detection**: Identifies and manages port conflicts

#### Key Features
- **Cache Size**: 2MB, 16-way set associative, 64-byte cache lines
- **Ports**: 4 L1 cache interfaces with independent arbitration
- **Coherency**: MESI protocol support with snoop interface
- **Performance**: Optimized for AI workload access patterns

### 2. L3 Cache Controller and Arbitration Logic

The L3 cache implements advanced features for system-wide cache management:

#### Advanced QoS Arbitration
- **Bandwidth-aware scheduling**: Tracks bandwidth usage per port with configurable limits
- **Priority inheritance**: Higher priority for L2 caches vs. accelerators
- **Adaptive aging**: Prevents starvation with exponential aging algorithm
- **Cycle-based bandwidth reset**: Periodic bandwidth counter reset (every 4096 cycles)

#### Enhanced Features
- **Cache Size**: 8MB, 16-way set associative, 64-byte cache lines
- **Ports**: 8 interfaces (L2 caches + accelerators)
- **Prefetching**: Stride-based prefetcher for sequential access patterns
- **Performance Monitoring**: Hit/miss/eviction counters with real-time statistics

### 3. ECC Error Detection and Correction

Both L2 and L3 caches implement enhanced SECDED (Single Error Correction, Double Error Detection) ECC:

#### SECDED Implementation
- **Hamming Code**: 8-bit ECC for 512-bit data words
- **Single-bit correction**: Automatic correction of single-bit errors
- **Double-bit detection**: Detection and reporting of uncorrectable errors
- **Error logging**: Counters for single and double-bit errors
- **Background scrubbing**: Periodic ECC checking (L3 only)

#### Error Handling
- **Correctable errors**: Automatic correction with logging
- **Uncorrectable errors**: Error reporting with address information
- **Statistics tracking**: Error rate monitoring for reliability analysis
- **Graceful degradation**: System continues operation with error reporting

### 4. Cache Hierarchy Integration

The L2/L3 integration provides:

#### Multi-Level Cache Coordination
- **Inclusive hierarchy**: L3 includes all L2 content for coherency
- **Write-through/write-back**: Configurable write policies
- **Victim cache**: L3 acts as victim cache for L2 evictions
- **Coherency maintenance**: Snoop-based coherency between levels

#### Performance Optimizations
- **Parallel lookup**: Concurrent L2/L3 tag lookups where possible
- **Prefetch coordination**: L3 prefetcher informed by L2 miss patterns
- **Bandwidth optimization**: Intelligent request scheduling between levels

## Testing and Verification

The implementation includes extensive testing:

#### Functional Tests
