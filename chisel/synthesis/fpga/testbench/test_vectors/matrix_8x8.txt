# 8x8 Matrix Multiplication Test Vectors
# Format: Matrix A (64 values) | Matrix B (64 values) -> Expected Result (64 values)

# Test 1: Identity matrix
# A = I (identity), B = random
# Expected: Result = B

# Test 2: Zero matrix
# A = 0, B = random
# Expected: Result = 0

# Test 3: Simple pattern
# A[i][j] = i+1, B[i][j] = j+1
# Manual calculation required for expected result

# Note: Full test vectors are generated programmatically in test scripts
# This file serves as documentation for test vector format
