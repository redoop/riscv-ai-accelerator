#### 4. Network Interface Controller (`noc_interface.sv`)
- Processor-to-network interface
- Packet packetization and depacketization
- Transmit and receive buffering
- Address-to-coordinate mapping
- QoS support for different traffic classes

#### 5. Mesh Network (`noc_mesh.sv`)
- 4x4 mesh topology implementation

- Network-wide performance monitoring
- Congestion detection and management
- Latency measurement infrastructure

#### 6. Supporting Modules
- `round_robin_arbiter.sv`: Fair arbitration among requesters
- `priority_encoder.sv`: Priority-based request encoding

### Key Features Implemented

#### Deadlock Avoidance
- XY routing algorithm ensures no cyclic dependencies
- Virtual channels provide additional deadlock freedom
- Proper flow control prevents buffer overflow

#### Flow Control
- Credit-based flow control with ready/valid signals
- Input buffering at each router port
- Backpressure propagation to prevent packet loss

#### Quality of Service (QoS)
- 4-level priority system (URGENT, HIGH, NORMAL, LOW)
- Priority-aware virtual channel allocation
- QoS-based packet scheduling

#### Performance Monitoring
- Packet counting and routing statistics
- Buffer occupancy monitoring
- Congestion detection mechanisms
- Network utilization metrics

### Test Infrastructure

#### Router Unit Tests (`test_noc_router.sv`)
- Basic routing functionality verification
- XY routing algorithm testing
- Virtual channel operation validation
- Flow control mechanism testing
- Deadlock avoidance verification
